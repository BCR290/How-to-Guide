				<!-- info of page goes here --> 	
				<p>
					Once you have Ruby and Rails installed you need to have a server that has Rails to run the program. But most people don't have access to a server. So Rails has a way that you can Create a local server that uses files that you already have downloaded to make it so you can run your application without a connection to a server or the internet.
				</p>

				<p>
					Run the command: 
				</p>
				
				<div class="code">
					$rails server
				</div>

				<p>
					This will start the a local server and it should tell you the port number. In your browser put <strong>http://localhost:</strong> and then the port that they gave you. For example my computer gives me the port number of 3000, so I would go to http://localhost:3000. When you visit your local host server it should show you a ruby on rails "site" with some documentation, and other healpful things. I would suggest using this as you go along as well.
