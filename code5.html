				<!-- info of page goes here --> 	
				<p>
					With the router and the controller set up we can now make a view!
				</p>

				<p>
					In the <strong>apps/views/controller_name</strong> file that was created when we made a controller we can create a file that will work as our view. This file needs to be saves with the extension html.erb. This extension allows the program to make the HTML with the possible Ruby elements that might be inline with the HTML.  
				</p>

				<p>
					Also with this file type you don't need to specifiy the DOCTYPE or The HEAD or the BODY. These usually needed HTML elements are already taken care for us as part of the Rails framework and we will go over that in a later section.
				</p>

				<div class="code">
					&lt;div id="main"&gt;<br>
						<span class="tab"></span>&lt;p&gt; This is a Rail App! &lt;/p&gt;<br>
					&lt;/div&gt;<br>
				</div>

				<p>
					This will do for now, and the Rail App should work now! It doesn't do much but it works. We will get it to do some stuff later.
				</p>
